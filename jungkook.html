                Yes. I try to savour that heartache. I would play sad music and embrace the sadness. And when 
                I’m in the car at night, I like listening to calm music, and in the daytime, fun music. Sometimes 
                I’ll seek out what’s trendy and other times, what’s old. I can’t get a good handle on my own feelings. 
                But there’ve been times when I thought a track was so-so, only to come back to it later and be surprised 
                at how good it is. It’s why I like to listen to music at random.
            </p>

            <p class="q"><b>Because you continue to endure the cold. Because you’re at a point where you could enter some 
                place warm and relax, but you choose to punish yourself instead. Even now, you cry after a performance 
                because you feel that you weren’t good enough.</b></p>

            <p class="q"><b>I think of it as grit.</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                I’d be thankful if you described it as grit, but…I just can’t stay still. I find it hard to rest for a long 
                time. I mean, it’s hard on my mind. So I need to be doing something. Even if I tell myself, “Lay everything 
                down, don’t worry about anything else, and let’s have a day just to myself,” I’ll end up doing something. 
                Since I’m going to be like this anyway, I think it’s better to just work hard. Even if I hate working out, 
                I work out; if I think of a melody, I go record it right away; if I suddenly want to write lyrics, I write 
                them and erase them, write them and erase them; and if I see an English book in front of me, I flip through 
                it. I’m always trying to do a lot of things, though I don’t dig so deep. It would be nice if I did. That’s 
                my life these days.

                Mmm…a hexagon that’s broken, cracked.

            <p class="q"><b>I feel as though I know what you mean, but could you describe it in your own words?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                I’m always wanting to be perfect and I’m always trying to climb higher. I do think I have enough talent, 
                but I also believe I’m lazy. I have two completely contradictory tendencies. I want to climb higher, but 
                at the same time, I don’t want to. They say the hexagon is the most perfect shape. But there’s a crack in 
                mine. It’s not perfect. It wants to be, but it keeps breaking.
            </p>

            <p class="q"><b>A hexagon with no cracks?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                That’s right. Maybe the pinnacle is when I’m finally content with myself. Say I was content with everything 
                right now. Then I’d have nothing to wish for. I wouldn’t want to climb higher either. Some day when a moment 
                like that comes, maybe it would mean I’ve finally reached the top?
