                I’m always wanting to be perfect and I’m always trying to climb higher. I do think I have enough talent, 
                but I also believe I’m lazy. I have two completely contradictory tendencies. I want to climb higher, but 
                at the same time, I don’t want to. They say the hexagon is the most perfect shape. But there’s a crack in 
                mine. It’s not perfect. It wants to be, but it keeps breaking.

                That’s right. Maybe the pinnacle is when I’m finally content with myself. Say I was content with everything 
                right now. Then I’d have nothing to wish for. I wouldn’t want to climb higher either. Some day when a moment 
                like that comes, maybe it would mean I’ve finally reached the top?

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                Jungkook's answers resonates with me because I too have perfectionist tendencies. But I'm also a procrastinator
                at heart, which is a perfect match, haha. But in all seriousness, as the oldest child in my family, I'm expected
                to be perfect in every way, to not let anyone down. But at the same time, sometimes I don't want to be. 
                <br><br> It's a whole cycle of wanting to be perfect and trying and when it doesn't work out, just getting
                discouraged and not trying the next time. What Jungkook says - "Maybe the pinnacle is when I'm finally content
                with myself" - is ideally the goal. We live with ourselves, and humans aren't perfect. Expecting to be perfect
                doesn't do anything for anyone. Not meeting the expectations for ourselves just makes us feel worse about ourselves.
                Ultimately what we should do is give ourselves grace and be content with how we are.
