                Mmm…a hexagon that’s broken, cracked.

                I’m always wanting to be perfect and I’m always trying to climb higher. I do think I have enough talent, 
                but I also believe I’m lazy. I have two completely contradictory tendencies. I want to climb higher, but 
                at the same time, I don’t want to. They say the hexagon is the most perfect shape. But there’s a crack in 
                mine. It’s not perfect. It wants to be, but it keeps breaking.
            </p>

            <p class="q"><b>A hexagon with no cracks?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                That’s right. Maybe the pinnacle is when I’m finally content with myself. Say I was content with everything 
                right now. Then I’d have nothing to wish for. I wouldn’t want to climb higher either. Some day when a moment 
                like that comes, maybe it would mean I’ve finally reached the top?
