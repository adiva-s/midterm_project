            <p class="q"><b>What difference is there between “BTS Jin” and “soloist Jin”? As you mentioned, 
                I was able to feel the depth of your emotions more clearly with every solo track you released.</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                Because BTS’ tracks are made by seven people coming together as one, we can’t adjust the key 
                or interpretation of a song to suit just one member. But it’s possible in a solo track. The 
                production and style are tailored to me. For example, we can choose a key that would best 
                accommodate my vocal range and sweet spot. It’s the same with the lyrics and melody.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <p class="q"><b>What kind of message do you want to deliver in your solo tracks?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                To be honest, I’m a bit cautious. I hesitate to write about things I can’t completely 
                relate to. Let’s take environmental issues as an example. Even if I want to write a song 
                about the environment, there’s a part of me that can’t help wondering, “Do I have the right 
                to write about this? Am I someone who truly embodies, and lives out, this topic?” It’s 
                something I have to consider deeply. But there are, as always, many urgent issues that need 
                to be brought to light. I’m sure there’ll be a story I’d want to share at some point.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <p class="q"><b>Is there a song or album that resonated particularly with you?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                That would be “Fire.” The words “live as you please” really spoke to me. It made me 
                realise that those who hate me will hate me regardless of what I do, but those who 
                love me will stay by my side.

            <p class="q"><b>BTS has always brought us new music, performances, and messages. It makes me 
                think that your position as a leader of trends, of bringing something new each time, may 
                feel like a heavy burden to bear.</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                Yes, it is a burden. After all, we can’t do the same thing every time. We often talk 
                amongst ourselves, saying, “I have no idea what to write about these days,” “Our 
                experiences are limited and what we do is pretty much the same, so what can we write
                about?" or “I wonder if what I experienced is actually right.” When I talk to the other 
                members, I realise we’re all shouldering a level of burden.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <p class="q"><b>BTS recently appeared on an entertainment program where you gave your opinion 
                on the nature of rest. Many empathised with it and your words became a hot topic. If you 
                were granted a month of rest, how would you spend it?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                Just thinking about it makes me happy. [laughs] But I don’t think I’d spend that much time 
                resting. We endured two months of forced rest due to the pandemic. Initially we all rejoiced 
                at the prospect of unexpected rest, yet that feeling lasted exactly two weeks. We were all 
                struggling after just a month of rest. We felt anxious and wondered if it was okay to keep 
                resting like that. So if I had to rest for a month, I’d probably work on my music here and 
                there. Maybe I’d do some farming or find something else to do to pass the time.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            
            <p class="q"><b>It’s the new year again. If you had to write in a card, what kind of greeting 
                would you compose?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                Hmm, I’m not sure if I can say this, but as we approach the new year, I’d like to tell all 
                the young people that they’ve done a good job and that they’re still doing a good job. That 
                if they’re carrying some burden about new beginnings, it’s okay for them to put down that burden 
                for a bit, and that I hope they can learn to enjoy themselves as they start out on this new path. 
                I would like to cheer them on in this way.
            </p>
