    <h3> "A New Year's message of hope for all starting something new."</h3>
    <br><br>

    <div class="content">
        
        <div class="text">
            <p class="q"><b>Is there a song or album that resonated particularly with you?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                That would be “Fire.” The words “live as you please” really spoke to me. It made me 
                realise that those who hate me will hate me regardless of what I do, but those who 
                love me will stay by my side.
            </p><br><br>

            <p class="q"><b>It’s the new year again. If you had to write in a card, what kind of greeting 
                would you compose?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                Hmm, I’m not sure if I can say this, but as we approach the new year, I’d like to tell all 
                the young people that they’ve done a good job and that they’re still doing a good job. That 
                if they’re carrying some burden about new beginnings, it’s okay for them to put down that burden 
                for a bit, and that I hope they can learn to enjoy themselves as they start out on this new path. 
                I would like to cheer them on in this way.
            </p><br><br>
