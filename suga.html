            <p class="q"><b>It feels as though BTS SUGA has a soft spot for the word “dream.” The counsel 
                that you’ve given – that everyone is equal before their dreams and that it’s okay to not 
                have a dream – has been a balm for many. But at times, the existence of a dream or goal 
                can be a crucial form of motivation. What should we do when we feel like a lost child 
                before our dreams?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                We can’t give our dreams too much meaning. Dreams are just dreams. When I say it’s okay 
                to not have a dream, it’s because you don’t really need one. You shouldn’t have to struggle 
                so much in order to live your life. It’s heartbreaking to see people being pushed to pursue 
                one path when there are 7.8 billion people in the world, living out 7.8 billion different 
                lives. People in their 60s and 70s can dream too, of course, but I often think that the
                world is especially cruel to the young. It’s often suggested that they’ve failed if they 
                don’t start out on a particular path or continue along as expected. But as you live, you 
                realise life doesn’t work that way. It would be good if children and youth didn’t blame 
                themselves too much, because it’s not their fault.<br><br>
                And don’t compare yourself to other people either. There is absolutely no need for you to 
                compare the size of your dream to someone else’s dream. You’d think I live with super grandiose
                dreams, but I’m not like that at all. I don’t have a dream right now either. Does that make me 
                miserable? No, it doesn’t. Rather, I’m at peace. I’m sure another dream will come to me. My 
                dream could be to become better at basketball, for example. I believe it’s a good, worthwhile 
                life to achieve dreams like this, one by one.
            </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                In Suga's words, I find a lot of comfort especially considering how society is, pushing us to achieve
                anything and everything. The same can be said for how a lot of families can be like, pushing their 
                children to live all these lives or accomplish many things as a to-do list. And as someone who's entire 
                life is based on that - and I'm sure that others can relate as well - Suga's words heavily comfort me.
                <br><br> To know that, my life isn't over if I don't start on a specific path or if I can't continue it.
                To know that, life doesn't work like that. And to know that if I don't accomplish a dream, nothing will 
                be ruined. It doesn't determine anything about my life or who I am.
