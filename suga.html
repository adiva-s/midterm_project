            <p class="q"><b>Yes, you do seem very relaxed. How do you manage to keep so balanced and calm?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                It’s possible if you take a step back and observe the situation from a bit of distance. People are 
                bound to become emotional and go to extremes at times, but you can gain a sense of clarity if you 
                just hold on and take a step back. When things get heated, I stop everything so that I can think. 
                This is probably why I don’t get into arguments.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <p class="q"><b>Are there things you’re right about now that you were wrong about before?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                Oh, so many. I think I was particularly affected by what people thought or said when we first 
                debuted. I became very sensitive to their responses, some of them malicious. But I never actually 
                met anyone who said these things to me in person. Not one. It was unwise of me to spend so much 
                time online back then. From a certain point, I felt that it was too far removed from the real world. 
                The issues that seemed to be a big deal online didn’t hold any weight in reality. I spend minimal 
                time online now.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <p class="q"><b>Your outlook and approach to music must have changed over the years, so I’m curious 
                about what exactly has caused you to rise up time and time again. If it was “han” [a Korean-specific 
                emotion of deep sorrow] in prior years, what would you say is your fuel these days?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                I’d say it’s the interesting thoughts within me. It’s a rare move for someone like myself to work on 
                external projects, whether they’re commercials, advertisements, or easy-listening tracks. But these 
                challenges are a lot of fun. It makes me look forward to tomorrow. “Han” and rage tend to gnaw at a 
                person, so I’ve put those emotions to rest and I’m trying to use positive energy instead.

            <p class="q"><b>It feels as though BTS SUGA has a soft spot for the word “dream.” The counsel 
                that you’ve given – that everyone is equal before their dreams and that it’s okay to not 
                have a dream – has been a balm for many. But at times, the existence of a dream or goal 
                can be a crucial form of motivation. What should we do when we feel like a lost child 
                before our dreams?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                We can’t give our dreams too much meaning. Dreams are just dreams. When I say it’s okay 
                to not have a dream, it’s because you don’t really need one. You shouldn’t have to struggle 
                so much in order to live your life. It’s heartbreaking to see people being pushed to pursue 
                one path when there are 7.8 billion people in the world, living out 7.8 billion different 
                lives. People in their 60s and 70s can dream too, of course, but I often think that the
                world is especially cruel to the young. It’s often suggested that they’ve failed if they 
                don’t start out on a particular path or continue along as expected. But as you live, you 
                realise life doesn’t work that way. It would be good if children and youth didn’t blame 
                themselves too much, because it’s not their fault.<br><br>
                And don’t compare yourself to other people either. There is absolutely no need for you to 
                compare the size of your dream to someone else’s dream. You’d think I live with super grandiose
                dreams, but I’m not like that at all. I don’t have a dream right now either. Does that make me 
                miserable? No, it doesn’t. Rather, I’m at peace. I’m sure another dream will come to me. My 
                dream could be to become better at basketball, for example. I believe it’s a good, worthwhile 
                life to achieve dreams like this, one by one.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <p class="q"><b>You’re saying that a dream, whether big or small, is just a dream. That’s refreshing.</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                I tried looking for reasons to live each day, but it turns out what I like most is being at peace. 
                It’s my dream to become someone who worries less and who has peace in their heart. That is actually 
                my dream, but I hesitate to say it, because it can sound hypocritical. Some might say, “You’re only 
                able to say that because you’ve achieved it all.” But I really wish we all had dreams no matter how 
                big or small that could become a driving force in our lives. There’s no need for them to be grand, either.
            </p>
