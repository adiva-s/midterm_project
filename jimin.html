            <p class="q"><b>Is there something you realised after having experienced one unbelievable moment after another?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                You shouldn’t stop after coming close to your dream, or even after fully achieving it. If we’d been satisfied 
                after performing in the Olympic Gymnastics Arena for the first time [in 2016] and thought, “That’s enough,” we 
                wouldn’t have been able to come this far. I believe we’re able to keep growing and evolving because we’re 
                constantly pushing ourselves to show all that we want to do.
            </p>

            <p class="q"><b>It’s a time when a person’s words can become a great source of strength, perhaps 
                more than ever before. What would you like to tell people?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                I’m not sure if this will help, but I want to say that whatever you’re doing, wherever 
                you are, there will come a day when the world will recognise all of your hard work.
            </p>
