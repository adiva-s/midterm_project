            <p class="q"><b>In the “ARMY Corner Store” Q&A released for BTS’ 2021 fan event FESTA, you 
                said you had a habit of having trivial thoughts. When asked what your hobby was, you 
                said it was lying down. I found these responses interesting. The combination of having 
                all sorts of thoughts while lying down lends itself perfectly to daydreaming. Are you 
                still doing a lot of daydreaming these days? </b></p>
            <p class="a">
                I’ve changed a little. Maybe I’ve found a sense of calm? I used to think it would be 
                nice to spend some time alone, letting time drift by like flowing water, but I think 
                I’m able to do that now. I’m enjoying my time alone without doing much.   
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <p class="q"><b>I bring this up because of what we said about daydreaming before, but when 
                I reflect on everything that BTS has achieved so far, I can’t help thinking that you 
                once had dreams that could have only felt vague and impossible. However, you’ve witnessed 
                them turn into reality, one by one. What does that feel like?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                There are so many moments that are unbelievable to me, even now. I still remember so clearly 
                how our concert venues got bigger and bigger, how our international fans would sing along 
                with us in our language, and even how we’d fly through the air on stage. There was also a 
                particular moment that really moved me. It’s harder than you think to see people’s faces 
                when you’re on stage. But it’s such a thrill when you can see those who hadn’t looked happy 
                at the beginning of the concert laughing by the end. It’s very moving. These are the kinds 
                of experiences that motivate me to keep performing.
            </p>

            <p class="q"><b>The work you share has such a positive influence on people. Can you talk about how that influences 
                your own life?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                It influences my thoughts, words, and actions. In a positive way, of course. It makes me think once more before 
                I speak my mind, and when I hear good things from our fans, I share it with those around me. When we were preparing 
                for our UN speech [delivered at the 2021 United Nations General Assembly], I was able to think more deeply about 
                environmental issues. I was challenged by the realisation that some of our fans younger than me are more invested 
                in environmental issues. I had the chance to reflect on my own actions and I asked myself what I could do to protect 
                the environment, and even whether I’m correctly sorting my trash and recycling.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <p class="q"><b>Is there something you realised after having experienced one unbelievable moment after another?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                You shouldn’t stop after coming close to your dream, or even after fully achieving it. If we’d been satisfied 
                after performing in the Olympic Gymnastics Arena for the first time [in 2016] and thought, “That’s enough,” we 
                wouldn’t have been able to come this far. I believe we’re able to keep growing and evolving because we’re 
                constantly pushing ourselves to show all that we want to do.
            </p>

            <p class="q"><b>It’s a time when a person’s words can become a great source of strength, perhaps 
                more than ever before. What would you like to tell people?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                I’m not sure if this will help, but I want to say that whatever you’re doing, wherever 
                you are, there will come a day when the world will recognise all of your hard work.
            </p>
