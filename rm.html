            <p class="q"><b>Are there moments when you feel as though life is sparkling?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                Ah… [with sparkling eyes] I’m not sure how I should interpret the expression 
                “life is sparkling.” If I’m to express it in my own way, I’d say it’s the moments 
                I’m faithful to myself. I believe I’m doing well when I’m making music and sticking
                to a routine, like maintaining my daily workout schedule. And when I get to meet 
                and talk to good people. You know those moments that fly by so quickly you can’t 
                even spare a second to check the time? It’s those times I feel as if life is sparkling. 
            </p>

            <p class="q"><b>When I read the lyrics you’ve written, they often feel like scenery to me. Not just images, but landscapes I can enter.</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                Painters I like tend to be that way. They allow me to experience a piece with my mind.
                 When you stand before their work, it’s as though you’ve been transported to a particular 
                 moment. Their work contains blank spaces. When I keep seeing and pursuing what I like, I 
                 find my own work begins to resemble those very things. I train myself in images by trying 
                 to express and implement musical textures through a variety of senses.
