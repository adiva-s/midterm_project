                I’ve been curious how your mixtape work has been going.</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                I know this about myself: I need a lot of time to work. I’m always jotting down ideas 
                and things I’d like to write about in a journal or notebook, but I think I need at 
                least three months to do something with it. Recently we’ve had a lot to prepare, so 
                I haven’t had much time to sleep, let alone work. I’ve pushed it aside for the moment. 
                When I have some time to rest, I’m sure I’ll work non-stop.

            <p class="q"><b>Is there something on your wish list that you want to fulfill as an artist?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                Hmm… (thinks for a long time) I often think that I’d like to write a really good song. The kind of 
                song I can be proud of in front of everyone, whether it’s in front of ARMY, people I know, anyone. 
                When I come back to a song I’d written a while ago and find that it falls short, I’m the type to 
                throw the whole thing out. Right now, there aren’t many songs that have survived this process. My 
                thoughts and feelings change often, and so do my lyrics and melody. There was a point when I realised 
                this cycle might never end, so my ultimate wish might be to leave behind a song that’s considered great 
                by any standard.

                Perhaps a part of yourself you never want to lose?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                I don’t ever want to lose my principles. I know it’s impossible to always do the right thing, but for me, it’s very important 
                to act with honour. I’d hate to be involved in any situation where my honour is compromised. Whether I’m performing on stage, 
                working on my music, or introducing myself, my confidence comes from having a clear conscience and sense of integrity. I believe 
                that’s how you can set yourself on the right path.

            <p class="q"><b>How would you write it so that he could understand?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                How about “woof woof woof woof”? (laughs) Hmm, Tan had a hard life. He’s always had health problems. He can’t 
                breathe well, because his airways are quite small, and he faints if he runs even a little, so he had to have 
                two surgeries this year, but they were unsuccessful… He has to rely on medication now. I want to tell him, 
                “Thank you for putting up with the pain, not giving up and staying alive, even though it must have been so 
                hard for you. I hope we can create a lifetime of happy memories together. I want to see you all grown up.”

            <p class="q"><b>This is the final question. What are your hopes for Kim Taehyung, BTS’ V, and ARMY in 2022?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                I’d like for Kim Taehyung to stay healthy and not get hurt. Because I just went through an injury, I can’t 
                help thinking this way. It’d be nice if V could write a lot of good songs to share with ARMY. And since 
                music videos and songs are connected, I’d like to make great music videos. My mind starts to race when 
                I start thinking about these things. As for ARMY, I wish there would be more chances to see each other.
