            <p class="q"><b>Aside from taking photos with your film camera, you’re also learning to play the trumpet. And you played the 
                saxophone when you were younger. You seem to be interested you in classical things.</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                Hmm, I think I’m just a sucker for sentimentality. I’m actually a little, well, a bit of a sentimentalist! (laughs) I’m 
                simple when it comes to the clothes I wear, antiques I like, or the art I enjoy. Whenever I see something and think, “Wow, 
                this gives me goosebumps,” “This is really moving,” “It’s pretty,” or “It’s cool,” I’m inspired to do the same. I’ll tell 
                myself, “I’m going to try to be like that too,” “Why does my instrument sound different from theirs?” “That’s a nice picture.” 
                “I want to try drawing too.” But at the end of the day, I think I’d rather watch and observe. (laughs)

            <p class="q"><b>This interview will be released at the end of the year. If you were to write someone
                a card to thank them, who would it be?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                I'd write one to Tan. That's Yeontan, my dog.
            </p>
            <br><br> 
            
            <p class="q"><b>How would you write it so that he could understand?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                How about “woof woof woof woof”? (laughs) Hmm, Tan had a hard life. He’s always had health problems. He can’t 
                breathe well, because his airways are quite small, and he faints if he runs even a little, so he had to have 
                two surgeries this year, but they were unsuccessful… He has to rely on medication now. I want to tell him, 
                “Thank you for putting up with the pain, not giving up and staying alive, even though it must have been so 
                hard for you. I hope we can create a lifetime of happy memories together. I want to see you all grown up.”
