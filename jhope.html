    <h3> "Even though it’s hard. I always try something new."</h3>

            <p class="q"><b>And you have a knack for brightening the mood. Many people talk about 
                your positive energy. But even you must have moments that are sad and difficult?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                It’s the hardest when I’m trying to “level up.” In those moments, I try to think not as
                j-hope, but as Jung Hoseok. In other words, I have to accept myself. It’s not helpful 
                to think, “I’m positive and cheerful because I’m j-hope.” I’m Jung Hoseok, a person, 
                and I have to accept that I can be sad, that I can cry and get annoyed. Thinking this
                way helps me go on. 
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <p class="q"><b>Don’t you find it difficult to turn your dream into a reality?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                Yes, it’s hard, but I enjoy it. I’m always attempting something new. In the process of 
                turning something abstract into something concrete, I carefully consider the feedback I 
                get. Since the experience helps me develop as a person, I can find reasons to enjoy the 
                process. For example, I was initially worried that my lack of English would make communication 
                difficult, but now I’m starting to think that if I make an effort to become better at English 
                and work with more artists, we could generate greater synergy. Everything can become a positive.
            </p>

            <p class="q"><b>Are you confident about the outcome when you first start to work on a project?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                No, I’m never confident about the result. Because everyone thinks differently, it’s impossible to 
                fully satisfy everyone. Rather than hoping that many people will like what I’ve done, I try to find 
                meaning in my accomplishments, that I was able to do my thing.

            <p class="q"><b>When you listen to BTS’ music, the emotions of each member when they were in their 
                teens and early twenties come through with such honesty and immediacy. What are you feeling 
                now as you enter your late twenties?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                I’m sad. I believe that nothing really changes when we age, despite the first digit of our age 
                increasing from “2” to “3” to “4”.” It’s better to come to peace with it. I mean, that’s what 
                life is, after all. Once I made up my mind that there’s still so much I can do in the future, 
                a lot of the emotions I had toward getting older disappeared. But I’m still sad. (laughs)
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <p class="q"><b>What have you gained in the past eight years as Jung Hoseok, rather than j-hope?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                I didn’t know what kind of person Jung Hoseok was. But after I debuted and spent a lot of time as 
                j-hope, I realised who Jung Hoseok is. I saw that I could be cold or aloof at times and realised 
                I had this side to myself. I can’t help but be thankful to j-hope. I feel secure, knowing I can 
                decide how this Jung Hoseok should act and live out his life.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <p class="q"><b>When you think of the future, are you more excited or scared?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                I feel different day to day. My happiness suddenly turns to sadness and back again. Until recently, 
                it seemed I was looking back and reflecting, trying to figure out how to push through everything 
                that scared me. But these days, I have a renewed sense of excitement. We’ll be able to see our 
                fans soon. We can carry out what we hadn’t been able to do and experience the moments that had 
                come to a stop, so it feels as though my fears are fading. So I have to say I’m more excited 
                about the future these days, rather than scared.
