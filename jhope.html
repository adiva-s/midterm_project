            <p class="q"><b>Don’t you find it difficult to turn your dream into a reality?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                Yes, it’s hard, but I enjoy it. I’m always attempting something new. In the process of 
                turning something abstract into something concrete, I carefully consider the feedback I 
                get. Since the experience helps me develop as a person, I can find reasons to enjoy the 
                process. For example, I was initially worried that my lack of English would make communication 
                difficult, but now I’m starting to think that if I make an effort to become better at English 
                and work with more artists, we could generate greater synergy. Everything can become a positive.

            <p class="q"><b>Are you confident about the outcome when you first start to work on a project?</b></p>
            <p class="a">
                No, I’m never confident about the result. Because everyone thinks differently, it’s impossible to 
                fully satisfy everyone. Rather than hoping that many people will like what I’ve done, I try to find 
                meaning in my accomplishments, that I was able to do my thing.

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                J-Hope talks about turning our dreams into a reality, which is something I appreciate.<br><br>
                Turning our dreams into a reality is no easy feat and can seem impossible at first glance. Thinking
                what should I do and where do I go from here will only result in panic and lead to discouragement.<br><br>
                From J-Hope's answer, I am reminded to take it step by step but to also enjoy the proccess and to worry
                about the present instead of what comes later. Preparing for the present lays out the fundamentals of the 
                future. 
                <br><br> The second answer is important to keep in mind. Like J-Hope says, it's impossible to fully satisfy
                everyone. It's better for us to be content and proud of what we have done. Ultimately this is our life. We 
                live as we please.
